# sql-challenge
Background:

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Structure: 
Example ERD png can be found in the main directory.
Our six CSV data files can be found in the Data folder
The code folder cotains the sql code to create tables and run analysis.
